# InsertRegionSet
10,000 traffic scene images from the GTSDB, TSDD [76], CCTSDB, and TT100K datasets, covering various weather conditions (such as sunny, rainy, foggy, and snowy) and different time. Based on the GB5768.2-2022 [48] standard, we manually annotated insertable regions using the LabelImg tool to construct the Traffic Sign Insertable Region Dataset
